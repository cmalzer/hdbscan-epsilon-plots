# hdbscan-epsilon-plots

This code can be used to reproduce the plots shown in the arxiv preprint paper "A Hybrid Approach To Hierarchical Density-based Cluster Selection" by Claudia Malzer and Marcus Baum (2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02282).

The algorithm described in this paper has already been merged into the scikit-learn compatible Python implementation of HDBSCAN (https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan).

For documentation, see https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_use_epsilon.html.
